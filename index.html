    Monetization Restrictions:

    You cannot monetize directly off .z domains. This includes, but is not limited to:

    Selling the domain itself.
    Charging for domain registration or transferring ownership for profit.
    Running advertisements or paid services on your domain, such as:
        Paywalls.
        Affiliate marketing.
        Ads or sponsored content.

    Content Monetization:

    While the domain itself cannot be monetized, you are still free to make money from the content hosted on your .z domain, such as:

    Donations (e.g., via platforms like Patreon or similar).
    Crowdfunding for your projects or services.
    Offering paid products or services (e.g., selling digital goods, offering consulting, etc.), provided the domain itself remains non-commercial and adheres to this policy.

    What We Donâ€™t Do:

    The ZPDS service is non-commercial:

    We will not charge you for using a .z domain.
    You cannot charge or monetize your domain or attempt to commercialize it through any form of direct or indirect financial gain via the domain.

    For Companies:

    Monopolizing .z domains is strictly prohibited. If a company attempts to take over multiple .z domains or uses .z domains in a commercialized way (including selling, leasing, or using them for direct profit), the company will be permanently banned from using the ZPDS service.

    Enforcement and Violations:

    Violations of this policy may result in warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent ban from the service.
    We reserve the right to suspend or revoke access to .z domains that violate this policy, including the removal of any domains that are sold, rented, or commercialized.
